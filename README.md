The user wants to extend the existing C program for pulse and symptom check to include dosage recommendations for medicines (pills/tablets) based on the user's age and condition. The user specifically mentioned that the app should not suggest homemade remedies, but instead suggest medicines like tablets, and the dosage (number of units) should be given based on age and condition severity.

To fulfill this, the program should:

Ask the user for age after pulse input
Based on age and pulse condition, suggest medicine dosage (number of tablets)
Possibly modify the symptom conversation to ask about severity/condition and then suggest appropriate tablet count accordingly
Include clear, simple, console-based interaction.
Plan:

After pulse input, ask for age (integer)
Analyze pulse condition as before
According to pulse condition (low, normal, elevated, high) and age groups (child, adult, older adult), set and display suggested dosage (number of tablets) for a hypothetical medicine
Keep the conversation step for symptoms as optional or separate
Maintain clarity that the user should consult a doctor also
Use simple examples of dosages per age group for demonstration.
Next step: Write the updated C program with these additions.
